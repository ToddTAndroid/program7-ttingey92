Description:

	After launching the app, enter host and port information as well as your values for bot-name, bullets, armour, and scan strength.
	Press MAKE CONNECTION to start.
	The SCAN button will request a scan and store a nearby enemy's position.
	The IDLE button will stop all bot functions by sending noop's.
	The middle cross-hair button will fire at an enemy picked up by the scan (emphasis: only if the enemy is seen by the scan).
	The FIRE AT POWERUP button will fire at a powerup, but only if the bot has not already seen an enemy. If it knows an enemy location it will always prioritize firing at the enemy bot. 
	The directional buttons (including the dot buttons) will send the bot moving in the chosen direction.

	Phone: Samsung Galaxy Note 5, 5.7"(Marshmallow 6.0.1)
